Keywords: Excel VBA, Macros

This excercise involved looping through stock market data to calculate and highlight/pull out the following:

1) Stock ticker symbol.
2) Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3) The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4) The total stock volume of the stock.

The VBA script also includes conditional formatting that highlights positive price changes in green and negative ones in red.
